    "    -Stability Issues: Problems that affect the app's reliability, causing it to crash, freeze, or become unresponsive unexpectedly. These issues lead to interruptions in the user experience, making the app unreliable and frustrating to use.\n",
    "    -UI Issues: Problems with the design, layout, and visual elements of the app. These issues include cluttered interfaces, poorly arranged elements, and visual inconsistencies.\n",
    "    -UX Issues: Pertain to the overall user satisfaction with the app, including how users interact with the app and how smooth and efficient those interactions are. These issues include unintuitive navigation, poor responsiveness, and a lack of user-centered design.\n",
    "    -Compatibility Issues: Occur when the app fails to function properly across different operating systems, platforms, or versions. These problems arise due to insufficient optimization or support for certain OS updates, versions, or configurations.\n",
    "    -Device-Specific Issues: Arise when the app does not function well or crashes on particular hardware configurations. These problems may include poor optimization for certain devices, resulting in slower performance or crashes.\n",
    "    -Bug: Encompass a wide range of errors, glitches, and malfunctions within the app that prevent it from operating as intended. These issues can range from minor visual anomalies to critical errors that cause the app to crash or behave unpredictably.\n",
    "    -Customer Support Issues: Problems related to the assistance provided by the app's support team. These issues include unhelpful, slow, or inadequate responses that fail to address users' concerns.\n",
    "    -Security Issues: Problems related to the app's ability to safeguard user data and protect against unauthorized access. These concerns may involve data breaches, vulnerabilities, and unauthorized data transmission.\n",
    "    -Privacy Concerns: Focus on issues related to the app's handling of user data and its privacy policies. These concerns include excessive permission requests, unclear or vague privacy policies, and the lack of transparency regarding data usage.\n",
    "    -Network Issues: Pertain to problems with the app's connectivity, such as difficulties loading content, syncing data, or maintaining a stable connection.\n",
    "    -Installation Issues: Encompass issues encountered during the download, installation, or initial launch of the app. These issues may include download errors, installation failures, or crashes upon launch.\n",
